# Project Quiver

![Project Quiver PT3](docs/images/quiver_wide-angle.jpg)

**An open-source, modular quadcopter platform for developers and operators.**

Project Quiver is a 25 kg MTOW drone with 5-8 kg payload capacity, three hot-swappable attachment interfaces, and a distributed electronics architecture. Built for reliability, field serviceability, and customization.

Developed by [Arrow Air](https://arrowair.com) and released under the CERN Open Hardware Licence.

## Key Features

- **Modular payload system** — Three quick-release interfaces (bottom, left, right) for mission equipment
- **Dual GNSS with RTK** — Centimeter-level positioning with backup redundancy
- **Distributed PCB architecture** — Four custom boards that can be individually serviced
- **25-31 min hover endurance** — Tattu 14S 30Ah smart battery with Hobbywing X6 Plus propulsion
- **ArduPilot firmware** — Standard QGroundControl/Mission Planner compatibility
- **Weatherproof design** — Sealed cockpit with rain canopies and drip-proof geometry

### CAD Assembly

The CAD source is a [build123d](https://github.com/gumyr/build123d) Python package that composes STEP files into the full drone assembly. This enables programmatic CAD generation and version-controlled mechanical design. See [`src/quiver/`](src/quiver/) for details.
